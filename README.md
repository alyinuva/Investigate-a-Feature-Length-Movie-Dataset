# Investigating a Feature Length Movie Dataset

In this project, I'll examine medium to high budget feature films. The dataset I'll use comes from IMDB and has data of more than 10 thousand movies, as diverse as films with 0 dollars of budget to extremely high budget films; from a bunch short movies to the longest film ever made (900 minutes). The reason I chose to focus on feature-length, medium to high budget movies will be explained throughout this project.

The main goal of this project is to investigate the general trends of budget, revenue and return on investment throughout the years; if the popularity of a movie is reflected in the revenues; if there is a relation between the genres of the most popular movies by year with the most commons movie's genres; and finally, what are the difference between high score movies and low score ones.

This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
